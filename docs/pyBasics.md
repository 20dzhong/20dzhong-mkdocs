# Introduction to Python

This is not a complete introduction for Python, this is meant to serve as an overview for what python
can provide.

A more thorough introduction to python could be found here: [https://codehs.com/info/curriculum/intropython](https://codehs.com/info/curriculum/intropython) 

## Data Types:

The 3 prominent data types in Python are: **Boolean**, **Integers**, and **Strings**. Those three data types appears everywhere and across languages as well,
although the specific qualities of which can be different.

* **String** represents letters and characters such as "abcdef", or "Hello, my name is John". **Strings** have quotations
around them.

* **Integers** are numbers, such as 1 2 3 4 5, or decimals, 12.3, 234.5

* **Booleans** are binary variables, being either **True** or **False**, they play a vital part in conditional statements

## Variables:

* Variables are place holders and references, it's where we give name to a piece of data.

* A variable can be different data types, like the aforementioned data types before, a variable can be a number: *nums = 30*,
it can be a string: *str = "Hello World"*, and it can be a boolean as well: *boo = True* 

## Operations on Variables:

Once you have a variable, you can do certain operations on them

!!! note "Operation Examples"

    ```python
        a = 10 # integer a is 10
        b = 20 # integer b is 20
        
        a = a + b # a is assigned to 10 + 20 and a becomes 30
        print(a)
        
        s = 'Hello' # s is String "hello"
        t = ' World' # t is String " world"
        
        # concat is a combination of s and t, this process of adding strings is called
        # string concatenation
        concat = s + t
        print(concat) # "hello world"
        
        product = concat * 4 # product is 4 * "hello world", hello world will be repeated 4 times
        print(product) # HelloWorldHelloWorldHelloWorldHelloWorld
    ```

Those are just very simple examples of some operations you can perform on those data, more can be explored in python's documentation
or other online courses
